<p>[September 17, 2018 - Update]&nbsp;Now the&nbsp;<a href="../../my/datasets/download/e2dc59a3-b969-4975-a6ef-32c02dce3fd6"><strong>Public Data</strong></a>&nbsp;contains <strong>the&nbsp;training and development data</strong> for English, French and German.&nbsp;It is different from the trial data because some fixes were made to tokenization.&nbsp;<span>Please use the data published here and not the data available on GitHub.</span></p>
<p>The <a href="../../my/datasets/download/8657da91-99b9-4b6a-9f20-5c7faea11a84"><strong>Starting Kit</strong></a>&nbsp;contains the full text of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea in <a href="https://github.com/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation/UCCA_English-20K/blob/master/20K_full_version_English.txt">English </a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation/UCCA_French-20K/blob/master/20K_full_version_French.txt">French</a>.&nbsp;While the first five chapters were annotated for UCCA and are available as part of the task training/development/test data, the rest of the book is unannotated. We release the tokenized text here, with features calculated by spaCy 2.0.11 and UDPipe 1.2.</p>
