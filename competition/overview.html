<p><br /><br />Semantic represetation is receiving growing attention in NLP in the past few years, and many proposals for semantic schemes have recently been put forth. Examples include Abstract Meaning Representation, Broad-coverage Semantic Dependencies, Universal Decompositional Semantics, Parallel Meaning Bank, and Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation. These advances in semantic representation, along with corresponding advances in semantic parsing, hold promise benefit essentially all text understanding tasks, and have already demonstrated applicability to summarization, paraphrase detection, and semantic evaluation (using UCCA; see below).</p>
<p>In addition to their potential applicative value, work on semantic parsing poses interesting algorithmic and modelling challenges, which are often different from those tackled in syntactic parsing, including reentrancy (e.g., for sharing arguments across predicates), and the modelling of the interface with lexical semantics. Semantic parsing into such schemes has been much advanced by recent SemEval workshops, including two tasks on Broad-coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing and two tasks on AMR parsing. We expect that a SemEval task on UCCA parsing to have a similar effect. Moreover, given the conceptual similarity between the different semantic representations, it is likely that work on UCCA parsing will directly contribute to the development of other semantic parsing technology. Furthermore, conversion scripts are available between UCCA and the SDP, CoNLL-U and AMR formats.&nbsp;Teams that participated in past shared tasks on SDP, UD and AMR, are encouraged to participate using similar systems and a conversion-based protocol.</p>
<p>UCCA is a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation scheme, building on the established Basic Linguistic Theory typological framework. It has demonstrated applicability to multiple languages, including English, French and German (with pilot annotation projects on Czech, Russian and Hebrew), and stability under translation. It has proven useful for defining semantic evaluation measures for text-to-text generation tasks, including machine translation, text simplification and grammatical error correction.</p>
<p>UCCA supports rapid annotation by non-experts, assisted by an accessible annotation interface. The interface is powered by an open-source, flexible web-application for syntactic and semantic phrase-based annotation in general, and for UCCA annotation in particular.<a id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" style="font-size: 8.33333px;" href="#fn1">1</a></p>

<h1 id="sec:task_definition">Task Definition</h1>
<p>The task consists in parsing text according to the UCCA semantic annotation. The task starts from pre-tokenized text.</p>
<p>UCCA represents the semantics of linguistic utterances as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where terminal (childless) nodes correspond to the text tokens, and non-terminal nodes to semantic units that participate in some super-ordinate relation. Edges are labelled, indicating the role of a child in the relation the parent represents. Nodes and edges belong to one of several <em>layers</em>, each corresponding to a &ldquo;module&rdquo; of semantic distinctions.</p>
<p>UCCA&rsquo;s <em>foundational layer</em> covers the predicate-argument structure evoked by predicates of all grammatical categories (verbal, nominal, adjectival and others), the inter-relations between them, and other major linguistic phenomena such as semantic heads and multi-word expressions. It is the only layer for which annotated corpora exist at the moment, and is thus the target of this shared task. The layer&rsquo;s basic notion is the <em>Scene</em>, describing a state, action, movement or some other relation that evolves in time. Each Scene contains one main relation (marked as either a Process or a State), as well as one or more Participants. For example, the sentence &ldquo;After graduation, John moved to Paris&rdquo; (see figure) contains two Scenes, whose main relations are &ldquo;graduation&rdquo; and &ldquo;moved&rdquo;. &ldquo;John&rdquo; is a Participant in both Scenes, while &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; only in the latter. Further categories account for inter-Scene relations and the internal structure of complex arguments and relations (e.g. coordination, multi-word expressions and modification).</p>
<p>UCCA distinguishes <em>primary</em> edges, corresponding to explicit relations, from <em>remote</em> edges (appear dashed in the figure) that allow for a unit to participate in several super-ordinate relations. Primary edges form a tree in each layer, whereas remote edges enable reentrancy, forming a DAG.</p>
<p>UCCA graphs may contain <em>implicit</em> units with no correspondent in the text. The figure&nbsp;shows the annotation for the sentence &ldquo;A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice.&rdquo;. The sentence was used by to compare different semantic dependency schemes. It includes a single Scene, whose main relation is &ldquo;apply&rdquo;, a secondary relation &ldquo;almost impossible&rdquo;, as well as two complex arguments: &ldquo;a similar technique&rdquo; and the coordinated argument &ldquo;such as cotton, soybeans, and rice.&rdquo; In addition, the Scene includes an implicit argument, which represents the agent of the &ldquo;apply&rdquo; relation.</p>
<p>While parsing technology is well-established for syntactic parsing, UCCA has several distinct properties that distinguish it from syntactic representations, mostly UCCA&rsquo;s tendency to abstract away from syntactic detail that does not affect argument structure. For instance, consider the following examples where the concept of a Scene has a different rationale from the syntactic concept of a clause. First, non-verbal predicates in UCCA are represented like verbal ones, such as when they appear in copula clauses or noun phrases. Indeed, in the figure, &ldquo;graduation&rdquo; and &ldquo;moved&rdquo; are considered separate Scenes, despite appearing in the same clause. Second, in the same example, &ldquo;John&rdquo; is marked as a (remote) Participant in the graduation Scene, despite not being explicitly mentioned. Third, consider the possessive construction in &ldquo;John&rsquo;s trip home&rdquo;. While in UCCA &ldquo;trip&rdquo; evokes a Scene in which &ldquo;John&rdquo; is a Participant, a syntactic scheme would analyze this phrase similarly to &ldquo;John&rsquo;s shoes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The differences in the challenges posed by syntactic parsing and UCCA parsing, and more generally semantic parsing, motivate the development of targeted parsing technology to tackle it.</p>

<p>Note that for the purpose of the shared task, the Time (T) category is merged with the Adverbial (D) category. That is, all the instances of T should be replaced by D.</p>

<h2>The TUPA Parser</h2>
<p>Two works have been published on UCCA parsing (<a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1104">Hershcovich et al., 2017</a>; <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1035">Hershcovich et al., 2018</a>), presenting TUPA, a transition-based DAG parser based on a BiLSTM-based classifier.</p>
<p>Several baselines have been proposed, using different classifiers (sparse perceptron or feedforward neural network), and using conversion-based approaches that use existing parsers for other formalisms to parse UCCA by constructing a two-way conversion protocol between the formalisms.</p>
<p>TUPA has shown superior performance over all such approaches, and thus serves as a strong baseline for system submissions to the shared task.</p>
<p>The code and documentation for TUPA can be found <a href="https://github.com/danielhers/tupa/">here</a>. Baseline output by TUPA on the official test data can be found <a href="../../my/datasets/download/c4585c10-ca5b-41a3-af25-cc7b139a6810">here</a>.</p>
