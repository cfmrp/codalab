<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<h4 id="submission-conditions.">Submission conditions.</h4>
<p>Participants in the task will be evaluated in four settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>English in-domain setting, using the Wiki corpus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>English out-of-domain setting, using the Wiki corpus as training and development data, and 20K Leagues as test data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>German in-domain setting, using the 20K Leagues corpus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>French setting with no training data, using the 20K Leagues as development and test data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to allow both even ground comparison between systems and using hitherto untried resources, we will hold both an <strong>open</strong> and a <strong>closed</strong> track for submissions in the English and German settings. Closed track submissions will only be allowed to use the gold-standard UCCA annotation distributed for the task in the target language, and will be limited in their use of additional resources. Concretely, the additional data they will be allowed to use will only consist of that used by TUPA, which consists of automatic annotations provided by spaCy :<a id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> POS tags, syntactic dependency relations, and named entity types and spans. In addition, the closed track will allow the use of word embeddings provided by fastText <a id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" href="#fn2"> <sup>2</sup> </a> for all languages.</p>
<p>Systems in the open track, on the other hand, will be allowed to use any additional resource, such as UCCA annotation in other languages, dictionaries or datasets for other tasks, provided that they make sure not to use any additional gold standard annotation over the same text used in the UCCA corpora.<a id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" href="#fn3"> <sup>3</sup> </a> In both tracks, we will require that submitted systems will not be trained on the development data. Due to the absence of an established pilot study for French, we will only hold an open track for this setting.</p>
<p>The four settings and two tracks result in a total of 7 competitions, where a team may participate in anywhere between 1 and 7 of them. We will encourage submissions in each track to use their systems to produce results in all settings. In addition, we will encourage closed-track submissions to also submit to the open track.</p>
<p>For ease of submission in addition to the UCCA xml files conllu, sdp and amr formats will be allowed too, such submissions will be automatically converted to UCCA using <a href="https://github.com/huji-nlp/semstr/blob/master/semstr/convert.py">this script</a>.</p>
<p>To convert manually: <br /> pip install semstr <br /> python -m semstr.convert [filenames] -f [format] -o [out_dir]</p>
<h4 id="scoring.">Scoring.</h4>
<p>In order to evaluate how similar an output UCCA structure is to a gold UCCA graph, we use <span> <em>DAG <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span>-score</em> </span>. Formally, over two UCCA annotations <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span> that share their set of leaves (tokens) <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and for a node <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span>, define its yield <span class="math inline">\(yield(v) \subseteq W\)</span> as its set of leaf descendants. Define a pair of edges <span class="math inline">\((v_1,u_1) \in G_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((v_2,u_2) \in G_2\)</span> to be matching if <span class="math inline">\(yield(u_1) = yield(u_2)\)</span> and they have the same label. Labeled precision and recall are defined by dividing the number of matching edges in <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(|E_1|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|E_2|\)</span> respectively. <span> <em>DAG <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span>-score</em> </span> is their harmonic mean.</p>
